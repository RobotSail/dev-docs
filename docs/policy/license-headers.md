# Policy on License Headers in Source Files

## Code Originating from InstructLab

* We prefer not to have a license header at the top of every file. We feel it is
  unnecessary.

* We prefer to have a single-line license identifier at the top of our source
  files, though it is not strictly required.

For example:

```text
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

* We do not include Copyright statements at the top of our source files. These
  statements are notoriously difficult to keep up-to-date and fully accurate and
  are deemed unnecessary.
